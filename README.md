# Computer-vision-SIFT-SVM-classification-
This project (in collaboration with Tomer Gofman) is a Computer vision algorithm pipeline based on SIFT representation vectors of multi-class images with SVM.
The pipeline includes pre-processing, various hyper-parameter tuning including parallel tuning, comparing linear and non-linear SVM kernels, and a results report.
The code was developed on Jupyer environment in python.
The method used is a representation of images by prototype vectors created with KNN and classification by prototype frequency histogram (of 900 bins) using a linear SVM kernel.

classification accuracy for 10 classes  ~ 64%.
